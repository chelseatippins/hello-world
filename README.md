# hello-world
This is my first repository.
Uh oh, it seems I've completely forgotten who I am. 
Just kidding. I've only somewhat forgotten.
I'm a mom, first and foremost, to the most amazing kid. He is and always will be my greatest accomplishment. Since becoming a mom, I don't really know who I am apart from that title but I'm in the process of figuring that out. 
Stay tuned!
